# profile-switcher

This extension makes easier to use multiple profiles in Thunderbird.

WARNING:
When switching profiles please make sure the profile you are switching to was made with the same version of Thunderbird as the version you are currently using.
Profiles made with higher versions of Thunderbird than the one you are using can not be used with Thunderbird, you will be prompted to create a new profile.
Profiles made with lower versions of Thunderbird than the one you are using can be used but will be upgraded to the version you are currently using.
It is very easy to inadvertently upgrade a profile with this extension.

The add-on adds new items the to the Tools menu to start another profile or the profile manager.
The menu is also provided on a toolbar button you can put on the main toolbar.

From the extension's preferences, you can choose what to do when you launch another profile, close the profile in use or don't.
If you choose to run the profile manager in safe-mode, the current profile will always be closed).

Where to see the name of the current profile:
1) On the list of profiles the current profile name is in italics.
2) You can show the current profile name on the toolbar button.
